### Tools to drive Tasks
https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/rome-platform-administration/page/administer/task-table/reference/r_ToolsForDrivingTasks.html

These tools can be run on any table which extends Task.

- Approvals
Approvals can be generated to a list of Approvers, either manually or automatically, according to Approval Rules. Approvals can be incorporated into workflows or can stand alone. For more information, see Process approvals.

Approvals can be used on tables that do not extend Task.

- Assignments
Assignment rules can automatically assign tasks to users or groups, ensuring that the most appropriate team members handle the tasks. For more information, see Defining Assignment Rules.

- Service levels
Service level agreements can track the amount of time that a task has been open, to ensure that tasks are completed within an allotted time.

- Inactivity monitors
Inactivity monitors ensure that tasks do not fall by the wayside by notifying users when tasks have been untouched for a predefined period of time. For more information, see Setting Inactivity Monitors.

= Workflow
An administrator can specify a specific workflow process to apply to tasks that meet certain conditions. After a task is created that meets the conditions, the workflow applies an automated process to the task. The process is defined in the graphical Workflow Editor.
